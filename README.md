# Tanks

## Description
I was asked one day to fill in for a colleague, and go to a Zosia conference to lead JS workshops.
The theme was supposed to be JS tank fights - so I created a simple game (in older ECMAScript, for quicker setup), where the participants would write their own tank behavior logic, and then compete.

## Rules
- Every tank can perform one action per round - fire its weapon or move in one of 4 directions.
- Every tank starts with 20 units of ammunition.
- Every 4 rounds, one additional unit of ammunition is added.
- Please do not hack into the infrastructure of the game.
